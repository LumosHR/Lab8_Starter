# Lab 8 - Starter

1. I would fit my automated tests within a github action that runs whenever code is pushed because it can test if the new push request works correctly under the same environment. If it doesn't pass the test, developers could fix it immediately. By doing so, we reduce the chance of making bugs.
2. No
3. No. I won't use a unit test to test the "message" feature because it involves a lot of components like sending, receiving and alerting the user so it is not appropriate to separate these functions and test them individually.
4. Yes, because this is a simple function that doesn't involve other function.
